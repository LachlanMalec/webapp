      <p className="mt-6 text-base px-10 md:px-0 text-justify leading-8 text-fg0">
        Hello! I&apos;m Lachlan Malec, a passionate Full-Stack Software Engineer at
        TestLab360 and a full-time Computer Science student at the Queensland
        University of Technology (QUT). In my professional life, I use my
        creative problem-solving skills and meticulous attention to detail to
        ensure seamless functioning of the software I contribute to. I have a
        keen interest in various technologies and programming languages, and I&apos;m
        always eager to learn and explore new tools that can enhance my
        capabilities.
      </p>

        When I&apos;m not juggling between coding assignments and professional
        responsibilities, you will likely find me immersed in the exciting world
        of gaming. My love for video games extends beyond just playing them; I&apos;m
        intrigued by their development process and the programming behind them,
        which perfectly aligns with my career in software engineering. In fact,
        one of my long-term goals is to eventually work on software development
        for gaming systems.

        I also have a fascination for the intriguing world of internet
        mysteries. The endless virtual maze often takes me down rabbit holes
        filled with interesting unsolved mysteries, coding puzzles, and hidden
        easter eggs - each one a thrilling challenge that tickles my curiosity
        and tests my problem-solving abilities.
